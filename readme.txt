[1] X. Shen, Z. Ni, W. Yang, X. Zhang, S. Wang and S. Kwong, "A JND Dataset Based on VVC Compressed Images," 2020 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo Workshops (ICMEW), London, United Kingdom, 2020, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/ICMEW46912.2020.9105955.

The VVC based JND dataset contains 202 source images with resolution 1920*1080 and 39 compressed images for each source image with quantization parameter(QP) set ranging from 1 to 100 through VTM5.0 intra. The source/distorted images are classified into 4 sessions in the folder session#_Ori/session#_Dis, respectively.

Each source image and its distorted images (a session) were viewed by 20 volunteers, their JND samples for the 4 sessions were recorded under ''f_session#.mat'' file.  Each file contains a 50*20 or 51*20 matrix, each row of the matrix represents the  raw samples from certain subject for the whole session.
